# Win10HotCorner

This is a quick-and-dirty window management hot corner for Windows desktops. It hooks the mouse and emulates a Win+Tab key chord when you bump the top-left corner; this opens up the task view which gives you an overview of open windows and virtual desktops. I have tested it sporadically through the years with Home and Pro versions of all major Windows 10 updates as well as Windows 11.

Note: It might not work (or may behave strangely) with multiple monitors due to the method it uses to detect the corner bump. I have not tested it with more than one monitor.
